My name is Rylan Schaeffer. I'm currently a Computer Science PhD student at Stanford in [Professor Sanmi Koyejo's lab](https://cs.stanford.edu/~sanmi/) researching
the science, engineering and mathematics of intelligence, both biological and artificial. I have previously been a Senior Research Associate
in MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences, a Computer Science Master's student at Harvard, 
a Research Engineer Intern at Google DeepMind, a full-time data scientist at Uber and
