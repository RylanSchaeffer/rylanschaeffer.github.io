My name is Rylan Schaeffer. I'm currently a Computer Science PhD student at Stanford researching
the science and engineering of intelligence. Previously, I was a Senior Research Associate
at MIT with Ila Fiete, a Computer Science Master's student at Harvard, a Research Engineering
Intern at Google DeepMind, a full-time data scientist at Uber and
