Finding your PhD advisor is perhaps the most critical decision you'll make in graduate
school. A good advisor
can set you up to transform the world, and a [bad advisor can drive you to insanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Streleski).
Consequently, I thought I might share a lesson in survivorship bias I learned
while rotating through 3 supervisors in the first year of my PhD.

Before starting, I was 
strongly recommended to speak with previous students to get a sense of what the advisor is
like, how to develop a productive relationship with them, etc. I made sure to do that, speaking
to an excess number of current and graduated students. I would ask blunt questions about incompatibility,
asking what type of person works poorly with the professor, probing what the worst outcome of
working with that professor has been. I am very appreciative that current and former students
honestly described to me what they felt are the pain points of working with their respective
professors, and in all cases, I found their descriptions to be correct.

However, upon rotating, I discovered that key pain points were omitted! Why, in the many 
conversations, did these additional details not arise?

Survivorship bias. A student's relationship with a professor is akin to dating (albeit where
one party holds financial control and commands the other party), and students have different
dealbreakers. Of the students that remain in a lab after rotating, these students are less
likely to notice potential disagreeable mannerisms and more likely to downweight them in 
significance. Consequently, the view that these students are capable of offering is a highly 
biased view.

What's necessary to obtain an unbiased view is to also speak with previous students that
worked with the professor and ultimately decided not to continue. However, to the best of my
knowledge, no such list exists (or certainly isn't public), and as such, an inefficiency
exists in the PhD-professor dating market that needn't exist. In retrospect, I wish I had
asked lab members for names of people who hadn't joined the lab and had spoken with those
few people far more extensively.
