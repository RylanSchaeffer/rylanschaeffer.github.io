Finding your PhD advisor is perhaps the most critical decision you'll make in graduate
school. A good advisor
can set you up to transform the world, and a [bad advisor can drive you to insanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Streleski).
Consequently, I thought I might share a lesson I learned
while rotating through 3 supervisors in the first year of my PhD in how survivorship bias 
creates market inefficiencies in the PhD-Professor pairing market.

_Disclaimer_: In many situations, I fell short of being a model student. This reflection
is not about placing blame, but rather how future PhD students might avoid the mistakes I
made in finding a supervisor.

Before starting my PhD rotations, I was 
strongly recommended to speak with previous students to get a sense of what each advisor is
like, how to develop a productive relationship with them, etc. I made sure to do that, speaking
to an excess number of current and graduated students (probably ~10-20). I would ask oftentimes
blunt questions about incompatibility,
asking what type of person works poorly with the professor, probing what the worst outcome of
working with that professor has been. I am very appreciative that current and former students
honestly described to me what they felt are the pain points of working with their respective
professors, and in almost all cases, I found their descriptions to be correct.

However, upon rotating, I discovered that the students' perspectives were often warped! Much to
my chagrin, I discovered that key pain points had been omitted. Why, in the many 
conversations, did these additional details not arise?

Survivorship bias. A student's relationship with a professor is akin to dating (albeit where
one party holds financial control and commands the other party), and students have different
dealbreakers. Of the students that remain in a lab after rotating, these students are less
likely to notice mannerisms that others might find disagreeable and more likely to downweigh
such mannerisms in significance. Consequently, these students offer highly 
biased views.

In order to obtain an unbiased view, a new PhD student should also speak with previous students that
worked with the professor and ultimately decided not to continue. However, to the best of my
knowledge, no such list exists (or certainly isn't public), and as such, an inefficiency
exists in the PhD-professor dating market that needn't exist. In retrospect, I wish I had
asked lab members for names of people who hadn't joined the lab and had spoken with those
few people far more extensively. This also suggests a desirable new service: [ratemyadvisor.com](ratemyadvisor.com)
