Emails to new people are oftentimes incredibly impactful, but hard to write, and I frequently receive emails that 
I feel could be improved. I've found a strategy that works well for me personally, and those that I shared it with
say it works for them as well.

The email should be three sentences long, excluding hello and your signature:

1. The first sentence introduces who you are, ideally with details that are relevant to the recipient

2. The second specifies why you are emailing the recipient, ideally with as much specificity and relevance to the recipient as possible

3. The third makes a concrete request that the recipient can satisfy in 15 minutes or less.

What's the reasoning behind the structure? 
Most people you want to email, especially ones with resources or decision-making capabilities, are insanely busy. 
They will be more inclined to give you time if you can make a compelling case that you are relevant and that they
are critical to whatever you need. If I email someone for help understanding eigenvalues, they'll tell me to go 
read Wikipedia, but if I instead ask for help understanding a tiny but important detail in a niche topic that only
they understand, then they are literally the only person in the world who can help me and will feel a much greater 
sense of obligation to help. I've found that by making a concrete and easily satisfiable request, the recipient is 
more willing to say yes. Once the recipient says yes they feel committed and are more likely to follow through.

Notes:

- I rarely if ever ask for a referral or a job. The person doesn't know me, so even if they 
feel comfortable referring me, their referral will not be particularly strong and may ultimately be a waste of 
both our times. What I almost always ask for is a 15 minute coffee or call. What I want from this conversation 
is to ask for their guidance on the topic that I think they are qualified to advise on. For instance, in one 
case, I called a guy whose team I wanted to apply for, and he told me over the phone that the team was culturally 
toxic and that he was leaving next week. Acquiring information like this can save you months of wasted time.  
I also want to demonstrate in this call that I'm a reasonably intelligent, well-adjusted person who can listen
and ask good questions. These are simple traits, yes, but people want these traits in colleagues, so demonstrating
that you possess them is basic but important.
- don't lie. Nothing in this suggests bending or violating the truth. If you are emailing 
someone you should have a genuine reason to be contacting them.
- Don't be offended if the recipient doesn't reply or if the recipient says no. Sometimes timing is poor. 
Sometimes people are over committed. If they don't respond, try twice more. If they decline, take the rejection
with grace and understanding.
