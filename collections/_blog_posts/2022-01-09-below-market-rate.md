title: Bay Area housing is f***ed in more ways than you might think

__TLDNR__: Everyone knows housing in the Bay Area is unaffordable. This is the story of
how I learned PhD students are too poor to qualify for low-income housing assistance.


Before starting my PhD, I was starting to stress out about where should I live.
The Bay Area is infamous for its usurious rent prices; to give you a sense of scale,
the [Bay Area's median income is $113k](http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Income-Inequality_3.10.21.pdf)
and my PhD salary is $44k (pretax), probably around the 15th percentile.
I didn't want to lose what little income I had to rent, so I had three choices:

1. A cardboard box (or maybe a tent) along 280
2. On campus, subsidized dorms, paying just under half my income to the university.
3. Moving back in with my parents, at age 28. My mom joked that there was room in the lawnmower shed.


I figured there had to be a better option, and when I started looking,
I discovered several cities up and down the Peninsula offer "Below Market Rate"
(BMR, for short) housing, designed to help low income people afford to buy a place
in the Bay. This was perfect! Instead of losing money to rent, I could build equity
in my own property. I applied, went through ~10 hours of required training, before I was able to meet
one-on-one with my personal advisor, Ana. After about 5 minutes of looking at my
profile (paystubs, W2s, etc.), Ana said to me, "I'm sorry, but you don't qualify."

"Could you clarify?" I asked. "I thought one had to be below the median income 
in order to qualify, and I most definitely am. Did I misunderstand?" 

"No no no," Ana said, "You make _too little_. BMR housing is for people that are
around 60-90% of median and you're too far below that."

She could tell by my silence that I was struggling to internalize what she had just
said. Before I could respond, she spoke up again with a suggestion: "I'm sure
you could qualify if you made just a bit more! Do you have a way to make an 
extra $10k or $15k a year?"

After my incredulity faded, I started looking into alternative income streams that
wouldn't cost me inordinate amounts of time. I tried all manner of ideas,
including sperm donation, male escorting and [online tutoring](2022-01-08-quitting-wyzant.html)
(which turns out to be far less lucrative than advertised).

A month later, Ana called back to check on whether I'd successfully found a BMR
property to apply for. I reminded her that she told me I was too low income to qualify,
and that I had found her assessment to be correct; she said she was sure I 
was mistaken, and suggested we look at properties together. After a half hour of searching
together, she agreed with my assessment and said it was highly unlikely I'd find anything.

Setting my own situation aside, this experience was a stark lesson that the Bay's
social safety programs can be structured in a way that excludes those who need help the most.
