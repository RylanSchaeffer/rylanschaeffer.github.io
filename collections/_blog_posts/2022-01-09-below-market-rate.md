title: Bay Area housing is f***ed in more ways than you might think

Before starting my PhD, I was faced with a dilemma: where should I live?
The Bay Area is infamous for usurious rent prices, and since my PhD salary 
is around $44k a year (pretax), I couldn't afford to live almost anywhere. To 
give you a sense of how little $44k is, the [Bay Area's median is $113k](http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Income-Inequality_3.10.21.pdf)
so PhD students are probably around the 15th percentile. I had two choices:

1. I could live on campus, in subsidized housing, paying 1/3 to 1/2 of my
  income to the university.
2. I could move back in with my parents, at age 28

I figured there had to be a better option, and I resolved to find it. I started looking, and that's when
I discovered several cities up and down the Peninsula offer "Below Market Rate"
(BMR, for short) housing, designed to help low income people afford to live
in the Bay. I applied, went through ~10 hours of required training, before I was able to meet
one-on-one with my personal advisor, Ana. After about 5 minutes of looking at my
profile (paystubs, W2s, etc.), Ana said to me, "I'm sorry, but you don't qualify."

"Could you clarify?" I asked. "I thought one had to be below the median income 
in order to qualify, and I most definitely am. Did I misunderstand?" 

"No no no," Ana said, "You make _too little_. BMR housing is for people that are
around 60-90% of median and you're too far below that."

She could tell by my silence that I was struggling to internalize what she had just
said. Before I could respond, she spoke up again with a suggestion: "I'm sure
you could qualify if you made just a bit more! Do you have a way to make an 
extra $10k or $15k a year?"

After my incredulity faded, I started looking into alternative income streams that
wouldn't cost me inordinate amounts of time. I tried all manner of ideas,
including sperm donation, male escorting and [online tutoring](2022-01-08-quitting-wyzant.html)
(which turns out to be far less lucrative than advertised by hosting platforms).

A month later, Ana called back to check on whether I'd successfully found a BMR
property to apply for. I reminded her that she told me I was too low income to qualify,
and that empirically, I had found her assessment to be correct; she said she was sure I 
was mistaken, and suggested we look at properties together. After a half hour of searching
together, she agreed with my assessment and said it was highly unlikely I'd find anything.

Setting my own situation aside, this experience was a stark lesson that the Bay's
social safety programs can be structured in a way that excludes those who need help the most.
