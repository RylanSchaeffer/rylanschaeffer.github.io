# About Me

Based on some [good advice](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~jowens/advice.html), I typically look like 
the person on the left. Quotes that have significance to me are displayed randomly on the bottom left.
My life's trajectory is succinctly summarized below:

- 2019 Fall - Present: I'm earning my Masters of Engineering in Computer Science Engineering at Harvard
University. I am currently conducting research with [Professor Ila Fiete in MIT BCS](https://fietelab.mit.edu/)
as well as [Professor Cengiz Pehlvan in Harvard Applied Math](https://pehlevan.seas.harvard.edu/) and 
[Dr. Nimrod Shaham in Harvard Center for Brain Science](https://cbmm.mit.edu/about/people/shaham). 

- 2018 Fall - 2019 Fall: I worked at [Uber Technologies](https://www.uber.com/")
as a Data Scientist on the Intelligent Decision Systems team. We specialized in time-series 
forecasting and anomaly detection. My teammates [Calvin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cworsnup/),
[Yuxi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuxipanucla/) and [Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-yajia-yang-b1b76a64/)
and I placed third in Uber's multi-week internal machine learning hackathon out of 50+ teams.

- 2017 Fall - 2018 Fall: I earned my Master of Research in Cognitive Neuroscience at 
[University College London's Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn)
under [Dr. Stephen Fleming](http://metacoglab.org/) on metacognition, where 
[Julius Kunze](http://juliuskunze.com), [Louis Kirsch](http://louiskirsch.com/) and I started
UCL's Artificial Intelligence Journal Club that featured 25 speakers in 9 months
from DeepMind, OpenAI, Uber AI Labs, Toronto, MILA, Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton,
Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial and other institutions.

- 2017 Summer: conducted research on applying supervised deep learning to DNA sequencing as
 an intern at [Thermo Fisher Scientific](https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home.html). My
 seq2seq model surpassed the company's gold standard algorithm and earned me my first patent.
 
- 2011 Fall - 2016 Summer: I earned two BS degrees at [UC Davis](http://www.ucdavis.edu/)
in <a href="http://cs.ucdavis.edu/">computer science engineering</a> and <a href="http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/">statistics</a>,
where I received the <a href="photos/outstanding_senior.jpg">UC Davis Computer Science Department's 2016 Outstanding Senior Award</a>
for teaching three undergraduate courses and for organizing and co-hosting over a dozen faculty talks aimed at
bridging the divide between undergraduates and professors. I intially started in biomedical engineering,
switched to business, and then pursued a major of my own creation
aimed at studying persuasion and motivation before choosing CSE and Stats. 
I also served as CFO and COO of [ASUCD](https://asucd.ucdavis.edu/) (overseeing a $12
million annual operating budget and 20+ units) and as the undergraduate representative on the UC Davis College
of Engineering Dean Recruitment Advisory Committee.
                
- 2011: I won the [national Congressional debate tournament](https://ci.uky.edu/UKDebate/results-history) in high school.
