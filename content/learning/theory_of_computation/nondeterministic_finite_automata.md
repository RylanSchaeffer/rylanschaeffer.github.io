# Non-Deterministic Finite Automata

Non-Deterministic finite automata (NFAs) are a class of "machines" in the theory of computation
that are perhaps one of the simplest classes possible and most limited in computational power.
NFAs are equivalent to both [Deterministic Finite Automata](deterministic_finite_automata.md)
and [Regular Languages](regular_languages.md).
