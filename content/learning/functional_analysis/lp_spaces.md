# L-p and l-p Spaces

$$L^p$$ spaces and $$\ell^p$$ are two related function and vector spaces,
respectively.

$$L^p$$ is the function space of functions that are square integrable:

$$L^p := \{f : \int |f(x)|^p dx < \infty \}$$

$$\ell^p$$ is the vector space of functions that are square-summable:

$$\ell^p := \{v : \sum v_n^p dx < \infty \}$$
