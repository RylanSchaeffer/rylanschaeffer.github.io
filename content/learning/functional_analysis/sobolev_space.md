# Sobolev Space

Sobolev spaces are spaces of smooth functions. More specifically

## Weak Derivatives

The weak derivative of a function $$f: \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$$
is a function such that for any smooth (i.e. infinitely differentiable)
function $$g$$ with compact suport (i.e. 0 outside some interval), the 
following equality holds:

$$\int f'(x) g(x) dt = - \int f(x) g'(x) dx$$
