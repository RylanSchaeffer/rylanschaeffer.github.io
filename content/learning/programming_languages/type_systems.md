# Type Systems

Most programming languages are split between either typed or untyped languages (untyped approximately
means dynamically typed). In order to discuss this distinction, what is meant by type?

The consensus is that a type is a set of values. For example, `int` is the set of all integers.
`bool` is the set of `{true, false}`. `List[int]` is the set of all lists containing integers.
`int->int` is the set of functions mapping from integers to integers.
