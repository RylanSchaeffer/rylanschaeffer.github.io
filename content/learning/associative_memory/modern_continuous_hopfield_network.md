## Modern Continuous Hopfield Network

[Up](../associative_memory.md)

The [discrete modern Hopfield network](modern_discrete_hopfield_network.html) generalized the  classical Hopfield 
network to obtain significantly higher capacity. However, its state space was still discrete: $$x \in \{-1, +1\}^D$$.

[Ramsauer et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217) proposed a continuous version of the modern Hopfield network.
The state space is now continuous:

$$x \in \mathbb{R}^D$$

[Krotov and Hopfield 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06996) also studied a similar model TODO
