# Coupon Collecting Problem

Suppose items have $N$ unique types (e.g. coupons) and every time we obtain an
item, its type is uniformly random. What is the expected number of items we need to collect
in order to obtain at least 1 item of each type?

Define $X_n$ as the number of items at which we obtain the $$n$$-th type.
