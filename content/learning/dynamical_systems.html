            <p>
              For non-linear systems, multiple notions of stability exist. The first notion of
              stability is an equilibrium point $x_{eq}$, defined as a point in the phase space
              with all derivatives equal to 0. However, equilibrium points aren't the only focus.
              We also care about the behavior of the system in general. Consequently, we have
              a sequence of definitions of stability.
            </p>

            <p>
              We say that an equilibrium point $x_{eq}$ is <b>stable</b> a point that starts within
              a small ball (defined by radius $r$) around the equilibrium point can be bounded in how
              far it can move away from the point. Intuitively, this means that the the system is
              guaranteed to remain "close" to the equilibrium point if it starts close to the point.
              Formally, we write:

              $$ \forall R > 0, \exists 0 < r < R \text{ s.t. } ||x(0) - x_{eq}|| < r \Rightarrow ||x(t) - x_{eq}|| < R$$
            </p>

            <p>
              We say that an equilibrium point is <b>asymptotically stable</b> if it is stable and
              if starting near the point guarantees that the system will converge back to the
              equilibrium point. Formally, we write:

              $$\exists r_0 > 0 \text{ s. t. } ||x(0) - x_{eq}|| < r_0 \Rightarrow \lim_{t \to \infty}||x(t) - x_{eq} ||
              \rightarrow 0 $$
            </p>

            <p>
              We say that an equilibrium point is <b>global asymptotically stable</b> if that initial radius
              $r_0 = \infty$. In this case, we say that the system (not just the point!) is globally
              asymptotically stable because we know that there can only be one equilibrium point. If there
              was another, then starting at the second equilibrium point wouldn't converge to the first
              equilibrium point, contradicting the claim that the point is globally asymptocally stable.
            </p>

            <p>
              We say that an equilibrium point is <b>exponentially stable</b> if starting near the
              equilibrium point ensures that (potentially after some elapsed time) the system
              converges exponentially fast to the fixed point. Formally, we write that

              $$\exists \delta > 0, \exists \alpha > 1, \exists \lambda > 0 \text{ s.t. } ||x(t) - x_{eq}|| <
              \delta \Rightarrow \forall t\geq 0,  ||x(t) - x_{eq} || \leq \alpha || x(0) - x_{eq} || e^{- \lambda t}$$

              One cool point is that if we write $\alpha$, which is just a positive value, as $e^{\lambda \tau}$,
              we see that the bound of $\alpha || x(0) - x_{eq} || e^{- \lambda t}$ can be rewritten as
              $ || x(0) - x_{eq} || e^{- \lambda (t - \tau)}$. This shows that $\alpha$ can
              be viewed as a time delay: the state will converge exponentially fast starting from $\tau_0$.
              We say that an equilibrium point is <b>globally exponentially stable</b> if $r_0 = \infty$.
              Similar to global asymptotic stability, we can describe both the equilibrium point and the
              system entirely as globally exponentially stable since only one equilibrium point can
              exist.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that exponential stability implies stability. To see this, suppose that a
              point $x_{eq}$ that is exponentially stable. For any bounding radius $R$, we can
              always find a corresponding $r < R$ to ensure that. Define $r = \min \{\frac{R}{\alpha}, \delta \}$
              and assume that $||x(0)|| < r$.

              \begin{align*}
              ||x(t) - x_{eq}||
              &\leq \alpha ||x(0) - x_{eq} ||e^{-\lambda t} & \text{Defn. of exponential stability and } ||x(0|| < \delta\\
              &\leq \alpha ||x(0) - x_{eq} || & e^{-\lambda t} \text{ is monotonically decreasing for increasing } t \geq 0\\
              &< \alpha r & \text{By assumption, } ||x(0)|| < r\\
              &< \alpha \frac{R}{\alpha} & \text{Holds regardless of whether } r = \frac{R}{\alpha} \text{ or } r = d\\
              &< R
              \end{align*}

              Thus we conclude that exponential stability implies stability.

          <h3 id="stability_via_linearization">Characterizing Stability via Linearization</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Linearization around a fixed point is the first method for studying the type of stability
              the fixed point has. The idea is to Taylor-series expand about the equilibrium
              point to first order and disregard higher order terms (HOT). Suppose our system is
              $\dot{x} = f(x)$. Then linearizing about a fixed point
              $x_{eq} = 0$ (if the fixed point isn't at $0$, perform a coordinate transform) yields

              $$f(x) = f(0, 0) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_{x=0, u=0} x + \text{ H.O.T.}$$

              Since $f(0) = 0$ due to being a fixed point,

              $$\dot{x} = f(x) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_{x=0,\\u=0} x + \text{ H.O.T.}$$

              If we drop the higher order terms, we call the simplified system the <b>linearization</b>
              or <b>linear approximation</b> of the system.

              $$ \dot{x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_{x=0,\\u=0} x$$

              The matrix $A \defeq \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}|_{x=0, u=0}$ has a name: the Jacobian.
              This leads us to Lypaunov's Linearization Method, which states:
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Theorem:</b> Let $\dot{x} = Ax$ be the linearization of some dynamical system.
            <ul>
              <li>
                If all eigenvalues of the Jacobian are in the left half of the complex plane
                (i.e. the linearized system is strictly stable),
                then the equilibrium point in the original dynamical system is asymptotically stable.
              </li>
              <li>
                If at least one eigenvalue of the Jacobian is in the right half of the complex plane
                (i.e. the linearized system is unstable), then the equilibrium point in the
                original dynamical system is unstable.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the eigenvalues of the Jacobian are in the left half of the complex plane or
                on the vertical axis (i.e. the linearized system is marginally stable), then
                no conclusion can be drawn about the equilibrium point in the original dynamical system.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Proof:</b> TODO
            </p>

            <p>
              To understand the third possible outcome of the theorem, compare the systems $\dot{v} + |v|v = 0$ and $\dot{v} - |v|v = 0$.
              Both systems' linearizations are $\dot{v}=0$, but the first system is asymptotically stable around
              $v=0$ while the other system is unstable around $v=0$. The reason is that the higher order terms
              we disregarded when linearizing the system contained the information necessary to make
              this determination. For another simple example, consider $\dot{x} = ax + x^5$ with corresponding
              linearization $\dot{x} = ax$. Clearly, if $a < 0$, the system converges, and if $a > 0$, the system
              diverges, but we can't say anything for $a = 0$.

          <h3 id="stability_via_lyapunov_functions">Characterizing Stability via Lyapunov Functions (Lyapunov's Direct Method)</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              Linearization is a useful technique in the local vicinity of a fixed point, but it isn't sufficient.
              We'd like to be able to describe the behavior of the system in
              general, even when far away from fixed points, and without having to integrate the
              differential equation. This led to Lyapunov's Direct Method, which is inspired by the idea
              that for a system with dissipating energy, the system must eventually settle down to a fixed point.
              Professor Slotine used the example of a pendulum; if $\theta$ is the angle away from the
              pendulum hanging straight down, both $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pi$ are fixed points. What
              differentiates them, though, is that the pendulum hanging straight down has no energy,
              meaning it is stable, whereas the pendulum upright has potential energy; if
              the pendulum is perturbed away from the upright position, and if the pendulum has friction,
              then the pendulum will eventually settle down to the bottom equilibrium.
              This motivates the idea of <b>Lyapunov functions</b>, which are energy-like
              functions that can be used to describe the behavior of the system more broadly than
              just around fixed points. The idea is to find a scalar function for the system which is non-negative
              and zero only at equilibrium; then, depending on the time derivative of the Lyapunov function,
              we can start drawing conclusions about the system's behavior.
            </p>

            <p>
              We'll first need some definitions. We say that a scalar function $V(x)$ is
              <b>locally positive definite</b> if within some ball $B_R$, $V(x) \geq 0$ with
              $V(x) = 0 \leftrightarrow x=0$. If the function $V(x) = 0$ at any other $x \neq 0$,
              we say that the point is <b>locally positive semi-definite</b>. If $R = \infty$,
              then we say the function is globally positive definite or globally positive semi-definite,
              respectively. (Globally) negative and negative semi-definite functions are defined
              similarly. We say that a scalar function $V(x)$ is a <b>Lyapunov function</b> if (a) $V(x)$ is
              locally positive definite, (b) $V(x)$ has continuous partial derivatives and (c)
              its time derivative $\dot{V}(t)$ is negative semi definite. If we can define a Lyapunov function
              for a system around equilibrium points, we can start to make claims about the stability
              of the equilibria.

              <b>Lypanunov's Direct Method Theorem:</b> If a system has a Lyapunov function $V(x)$ defined around equilibrium point $x=0$
              (if equilibrium is not at 0, perform a coordinate transform), then the equilibrium point
              is stable. If the Lyapunov function's time derivative $\dot{V}(x)$ is negative definite,
              then the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable. In table form:

              <b>(Local Stability) Proof:</b> Consider the first case i.e. $\dot{V}(x)$ is negative semi-definite. We want
              to show that $x=0$ is stable, which means showing that $\forall R > 0, \exists r < R$ such that
              $||x(0)|| < r \Rightarrow ||x(t)|| < R$. Find the minimum of $V(x)$ on the ball $B_R$.
              Since $V(x)$ is positive definite, $V(x) = 0$ only at 0 and $V(x)$ positive elsewhere. Since $V(x)$
              is continuous and $0$ only at $x=0$, a ball $B_r$ around $x=0$ must exist such that
              the maximum of $V(x)$ on $B_r$ is equal to the minimum of $V(x)$ on $B_R$. Then, provided
              a point starts within $B_r$, since $V(x)$ cannot increase, the point cannot escape $B_R$
              since this would require having a larger $V(x)$ than it starts with. The physical intuition is that
              the minimum $V(x)$ on $B_R$ determines an energy threshold. We then find the region entirely below
              this energy threshold (which is guaranteed to exist because $V(x)$ is continuous and $V(0) = 0$),
              and since energy can't increase, we know points within this interior region are trapped below
              the energy threshold.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>(Local Asymptotic Stability) Proof:</b> Consider the second case i.e. $\dot{V}(x)$ is now
              negative definite, not negative semi-definite. For the same reasoning as above, we know that
              there exists a ball $B_r$ around $x(0)$ must exist such that starting in $B_r$ guarantees
              the state never escapes $B_R$. We want to show that there also exists some $r_0>0$ such
              that if $||x(0)|| < r_0 \Rightarrow ||x(t)|| \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$. To show
              this, we'll use proof by contradiction, requiring a few clean steps. (1) $V$ is lower bounded
              and $\dot{V}$ is negative definite, meaning $V \rightarrow L$ for some limit $L$. If $L = 0$,
              then the system has converged to the fixed point and the point is thus asymptotically stable.
              Using proof by contradiction, we'll show that $L$ cannot be anything except 0. Assume for
              purposes of contradiction that $L \ neq 0$. Since $V$ is $0$ only at 0 and $V$ is smooth,
              there exists some distance $d_L > 0$ such that $||x(t)|| > d_L$. (2) Since $\dot{V}$ is
              negative definite, $\dot{V}$ is 0 only at $x=0$, and since $\dot{V}$ is smooth, $\dot{V} <
              \min \{ \dot{V}(x) | x(t) > d_L \} \defeq \eta$; simply put, $\dot{V}$ cannot approach zero because the
              function is 0 only at 0 and $V$'s limit $L \neq 0$ prevents the system from approaching $x=0$.
              But then, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, we know that $V(t) = V(0) + \int_0^t \dot{V}(s)
              \, ds \leq V(0) + \eta t$. This means that $V(t)$ must decrease at least linearly with respect
              to time, but this is impossible since $V(t)$ is lower bounded! Thus we find our contradiction
              and the conclude that any non-zero limit $L$ is impossible.

              However, both of these statements are local. We'd like to understand the global stability
              of the equilibrium point(s). What additional conditions are required to make a convincing
              statement? In order to assert global stability or global asymptotic stability, we need
              to impose additional requirements. One possible requirement is that $V(x)$ be radially
              unbounded, which is defined as $V(x) \rightarrow \infty$ as $|x| \rightarrow \infty$.
              This condition prevents the state from finding a solution whereby $V(x)$ tends towards
              but never reaches 0 by moving as far away from the equilibrium point as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Example: Consider $\dot{x} + c(x) = 0$, where $x c(x) \geq 0$ and $c(x)$ is continuous, which
              implies that and $x c(x) = 0 \Leftrightarrow c(x) = 0$. In English, this means that
              $c(x)$ has the same sign as $x$. Choose $V(x) = x^2 \Rightarrow
              \dot{V}(x) = 2 x \dot{x} = - 2 x c(x) \leq 0$. Since $V(x)$ is positive definite and
              radially unbounded and $\dot{V}(x)$ is negative definite, the equilibrium point $x=0$
              is globally asymptotically stable. We couldn't have obtained this insight from
              linearizing around the fixed point because we don't know what $c(x)$ is, but with Lyapunov's
              direct method, we are able to that the origin is globally asymptotically stable.

              <b>Properties:</b>One property of Lyapunov functions is that many can exist for a single system. Suppose $V$
              is a Lyapunov function. Then $\forall \rho > 0, \alpha > 1$, so is

              $$V_1(x) = \rho V^{\alpha}$$

              Suppose that $\phi(\cdot)$ is a scalar, differentiable, monotonically increasing function of
              its scalar argument. Supposing again that $V(x)$ is a Lyapunov function, so is:

              $$V_2(x) = \phi(V(x)) - \phi(0) $$

              To see this requires showing three facts:

            <ol>
              <li>
                $V_2(x)$ is positive definite (PD). $V$ is PD, which means that $V(x) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = 0$
                and thus $ V_2(0) = \phi(0) - \phi(0) = 0$. To show that $\forall x \neq 0, \, V_2(x) > 0$, we
                know that because $V$ is PD, $\forall x \neq 0, \, V > 0$ and because $\phi$ is a strictly
                monotonically increasing function, $\forall x \neq x, \, \phi(V(x)) - \phi(0) > 0$. Thus we
                conclude that $V_2$ is positive definite.
              </li>
              <li>
                $V_2(x)$ has continuous partial derivatives. We are told that $\phi$ is differentiable and
                by virtue of $V$ being a Lyapunov function, it has continuous partial derivatives. Thus
                $\frac{\partial V_2(x)}{\partial x_i} = \frac{d \phi(x)}{d V(x)} \frac{\partial V(x)}{\partial x_i}$
                and we conclude that $V_2(x)$ has continuous partial derivatives.
              </li>
              <li>
                $\dot{V}_2(x)$ is negative semi-definite (NSD). Because $\phi$ is a strictly monotonically
                increasing function, $\frac{d \phi (V(x))}{d V(x)} > 0$, and because $V$ is a Lyapunov
                function, $\dot{V}(x) \leq 0$. By the chain rule, $\dot{V}_2(x) = \frac{d}{dt} V'(x) =
                \frac{d \phi (V(x))}{d V(x)} \dot{V}(x)$. $\dot{V}_2(x)$ is the product of a positive term
                and non-positive term, meaning $\dot{V}_2(x) \leq 0$ is NSD.
              </li>

              <b>Problems:</b> Although succinct and elegant, Lyapunov's direct method has some shortcomings.
              First, it doesn't tell us how to define the Lyapunov function $V$. Second, possibly infinite
              functions can exist for one system, and all of them may lack some interpretable meaning. The above
              example uses a strong prior that the energy of a physical system should be equal to the kinetic
              plus potential energy, but this isn't generally applicable for all systems. Third, Lyapunov's
              direct method's requirement that $\dot{V}$ is unnecessarily strict; as we'll see with
              La Salle's Invariant Set Theorems in the next section, we can relax this requirement and still
              make statements concerning the stability of the system's fixed point(s).

            <p>
              One shortcoming of demonstrating stability using Lyapunov's direct method is that if
              $\dot{V}(x)$ is only negative semi-definite, we can't say anything about the asymptotic
              behavior of the system. But this feels counter-intuitive. For instance, consider a
              swinging pendulum with dampening. The velocity $\dot{\theta} = 0$ at the top of each swing,
              meaning that $\dot{V}(\theta) = \frac{dV(\theta)}{d\theta} \dot{\theta} = 0$ but we would
              expect the system to asymptote towards $\theta = 0$ provided it doesn't start at $\theta = \pi$.
              This is a shortcoming we can rectify using the notion of invariant sets.
            </p>

            <p>
              An invariant set $R$ is defined as a subset of the state space such that if a point starts in
              the set $R$, it never leaves the set $R$. Some examples of invariant sets include (a) the set of a
              single equilibrium point, (b) the set of all equilibrium points, (c) the entire phase space,
              (d) the trajectory of a point $x(t)$. Invariant sets will help us rectify the shortcoming
              of Lyapunov's Direct Method since it will allow us to differentiate the bottom of the pendulum
              $(\theta = 0, \dot{\theta} = 0)$ from the top of the pendulum swings.

              <b>La Salle's (Global) Invariant Set Theorem:</b> As with Lyapunov's Direct Method, there

              $R = \{x | \dot{V}(x) = 0 \}$ and let $M$ be the largest invariant set in $R$. If
              $V(x)$ is radially unbounded i.e. $||x|| \rightarrow \infty \Rightarrow V(x) \rightarrow \infty$
              and if $\dot{V} \leq 0$ over the whole state space, then all states globally asymptotically
              converge to M as $t \rightarrow \infty$.

            <p>
              <b>Example:</b> Consider $\ddot{x} + \dot{x}^3 + x^5 = x^4 \sin^2(x)$. Note that the system
              has a fixed point at $x=0, \dot{x} = 0$. Define

              $$V(x, \dot x) = \frac{1}{2} \dot x ^2 + \int_0^x u^t - u^4 \sin^2 (x)$$

              Then

              $$\dot{V} = - \dot{x}^4 \leq 0 $$

              Thus, because $\dot{x}$ is globally negative definite, by the Global Invariant Set Theorem,
              we conclude that the origin is asymptotically stable. We can make this statement regardless
              of whether $V$ is positive definite.

            <p>
              <b>Example:</b> One nice example that makes use of both the local and global invariant set
              theorems in the following. Consider the system:

              \begin{align*}
              \dot{x}_1 &= x_2 - x_1^7 (x_1^4 + 2 x_2^2 - 10)\\
              \dot{x}_2 &= -x_1^3 - 3 x_2^5(x_1^4 + 2 x_2^2 - 10)
              \end{align*}

              Note that there are two invariant sets: the origin $(x=0, \dot{x} = 0$, and the limit
              cycle $x_1^4 + 2 x_2^2 - 10$. To see this last one, note that:

              $$\frac{d}{dt}(x_1^4 + 2 x_2^2 - 10) = -(4 x_1^{10} + 12 x_2^6)(x_1^4 + 2 x_2^2 - 10) $$

              We'll consider a Lyapunov function that measures the distance from a point to the limit cycle:

              $$V(x, \dot{x}) = (x_1^4 + 2 x_2^2 - 10)^2 $$

              Taking the time derivative, we see that

              $$\dot{V} = - 8(x_1^{10} + 3 x_2 ^6)(x_1^4 + 2 x_2^2 - 10)^2 $$

              Thus $\dot{V}$ is negative except when $x_1^{10} + 3 x_2 ^6 = 0$ or $x_1^4 + 2 x_2^2 - 10 = 0$,
              and then $\dot{V} = 0$. By the Global Invariant Set Theorem, we conclude that all states
              globally asymptotically converge to either the limit cycle or the origin. But we can actually go
              further and make one additional statement about the system. We can answer where points
              enclosed between the origin and the limit cycle flow towards using the Local Invariant Set
              Theorem. Define $l=100$ and $\Omega_l = \{ x | V(x) < l\}$. This excludes the origin, since
              the origin is exactly at $V(x) = 100$. Then by the Local Invariant Set Theorem, all points
              between the limit cycle and the origin flow to the limit cycle. The origin is therefore unstable.

            <p>
              Since both Lyapunov's Direct Method and La Salle's Invariant Set Theorem both require
              cleverly constructing functions with particular properties, it's worth taking a moment
              to consider common approaches for defining Lyapunov functions.
            </p>

            <h4>Energy = Kinetic + Potential</h4>
            <p>
              Since almost any real system dissipates energy, a useful starting point is defining the
              Lyapunov function as the sum of the system's kinetic energy plus potential energy.
              For example, consider

              $$\ddot{x} + b(\dot{x}) + c(x) = 0$$

              where $b(\dot{x})$ has the same sign
              as $\dot{x}$ and $c(x)$ has the same sign as $x$. One immediate consequence is that a fixed
              point exists at $(x=0, \dot{x}=0)$. This is also the only fixed point as a fixed point requires
              $\dot x = 0$ and $\ddot x = 0$, which means $0 = c(x)$ must hold. But since $c(x)$ is zero
              only at $x=0$, $(x=0, \dot{x}=0)$ must be the only fixed point.
              Now, we define

              $$V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \dot{x}^2 + \int_0^x c(u) du $$

              which if we view the system
              as a non-linear mass-spring with damping, can be seen as the kinetic energy of the mass plus
              the energy stored in the spring. If we consider the time derivative of $V(x)$:

              $$ \dot{V}(x) = \dot{x} \ddot{x} + c(x) \dot{x} = \dot{x}(-b(\dot{x}) + -c(x)) + c(x) \dot{x}
              = -\dot{x} b(\dot{x})$$

              Since $b$ shares the same sign as $\dot{x}$, $\dot{V}(x)$ is negative semi-definite. Thus, by
              the local invariant set theorem, the fixed point $(x=0, \dot{x}=0)$ is locally
              asymptotically stable. If $\int_0^x c(t) dt$ is radially unbounded, then $V(x)$ is radially
              unbounded and the fixed point becomes globally asymptotically stable. This is a result we
              could not have achieved using Lyapunov's direct method.

              If we consider the characteristic polynomial of $A$, we see that $A$ has two eigenvalues
              $\lambda_1, \lambda_2$ which depend on the trace of $A$, $\Tr(A) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2
              = a_{11} + a_{22}$,
              and the determinant of $A$, $\det(A) = \lambda_1 \lambda_2 = a_{11} a_{22} - a_{12} a_{21}$:

              \begin{align*}
              \det(A - \lambda I) &= \lambda^2 + - (a_{11} + a_{22})\lambda + (a_{11} a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21})\\
              &= \lambda^2 - \Tr(A) \lambda + \det(A)
              \end{align*}

              Solving for the roots of this 2nd degree polynomial, we see that the eigenvalues are:

              $$\lambda = \Tr(A) \pm \frac{\sqrt{\Tr(A)^2 - 4 \det(A)}}{2}$$

              Depending on the possible values of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, we can classify the behavior
              of the fixed point $x_{eq} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$.

              Consider a linear, time-invariant system $\dot{x} = A x $ and a candidate Lyapunov function
              involving a time-invariant matrix $P$.

              $$V(x) = x^T P x $$

              Because $P$ is constant with respect to time, the function's time derivative is:

              $$ \dot{V}(x) = \dot{x}^T P x + x^T P \dot{x} = x^T (A^T P + P A ) x $$

              For any linear system, we know that the origin is the only fixed point. We would like
              to use Lyapunov analysis to determine whether the origin is stable or unstable. If we choose
              $P$ as a symmetric positive definite matrix, we know that the Lyapunov function will
              be positive definite. If we also choose $P$ such that $-Q \defeq A^T P + P A$
              is negative definite, then by Lyapunov's direct method, we can conclude that the origin is
              strictly stable (i.e. all eigenvalues' real components $<0$). This leads to the following
              theorem.

            <p>
              <b>Theorem:</b> A LTI system $\dot{x} = A x$ is strictly stable (all of $A$'s eigenvalues' real
              components $<0$ or equivalently, $A$ is Hurwitz) if and only if for any symmetric
              positive definite matrix $Q$, the unique solution $P$ to $-Q = A^T P + PA$ is also
              symmetric positive definite.

            <p>
              <b>Proof:</b> Choose a positive definite $Q$. Because $A$ is Hurwitz,
              $\lim_{t \to \infty} A t \rightarrow 0$. Using this property and the Fundamental
              Theorem of Calculus, we can write negative definite $-Q$ as:

              $$-Q = \int_0^{\infty} \frac{d}{du} \exp(A^T u) Q \exp(Au) du $$

              Taking the derivative inside the integral and applying the chain rule, we see:

              $$-Q = A^T \int_0^{\infty} \exp(A^T u) Q \exp(Au) du + \int_0^{\infty} \exp(A^T u) Q \exp(Au) du \, A$$

              Define

              $$P \defeq \int_0^{\infty} \exp(A^T u) Q \exp(Au) du$$

              Note that $P$ is positive definite because $Q$ is. Then

              $$ -Q = A^T P + P A$$

              Define $V = x^T P x \Rightarrow \dot{V} = -x^T Q x$. By Lyapunov's Direct Method,
              we conclude that the origin is strictly stable.

              The other direction is also straightforward. Suppose there exist symmetric positive
              definite $P, Q$.

            <p>
              For a linear, time-invariant system $\dot{x} = Ax$, the eigenvalues of $A$ tell us a tremendous
              amount. Can we draw similar insights from the eigenvalues of a time-varying matrix $A$? The
              answer is trickier. Consider the matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & e^{2t} \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$,
              which has eigenvalue $-1$ with multiplicity $2$. Solving component-wise, we see that while $x_2$
              converges, $x_1$ diverges:

              \begin{align*}
              \dot{x}_2 = -x_2 &\Rightarrow x_2(t) = x_2(0) e^{-t}\\
              \dot{x}_1 = -x_1 + e^{2t} x_2(0) e^{-t} &\Rightarrow x_1(t) = x_1(0) e^{-t} + x_2(0) e^{t}
              \end{align*}
            </p>

            <p>
              Why does such behavior emerge?
