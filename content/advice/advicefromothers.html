I said that if I had a cheat sheet that I could give myself at 22, it would have three things on it: a tennis ball, a circle and the number 30,000. The tennis ball is about finding the thing you’re obsessed with. The most successful people and successful entrepreneurs I know are all obsessed with solving a problem that really matters to them. I use the tennis ball for that idea because of my dog, who gets this crazy, obsessed look on her face when you throw the ball for her. The circle is really about the idea that you’re the average of your five closest friends, so make sure to put yourself in an environment that pulls the best out of you. And the last is the number 30,000. When I was 24, I came across this website that says most people live for about 30,000 days. So you have to make every day count."</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/business/drew-houston-of-dropbox-figure-out-the-things-you-dont-know.html">Drew Houston</a>: "Reading has been essential. I have always wondered why people put so much energy into trying to have coffee with some famous entrepreneur when reading a book is like getting many hours of their most crystallized thoughts."</li>

		<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk:_Tesla,_SpaceX,_and_the_Quest_for_a_Fantastic_Future">Elon Musk's Biography: </a>"For Gracias, the Tesla and SpaceX investor and Musk’s friend, the 2008 period told him everything he would ever need to know about Musk’s character. He saw a man who arrived in the United States with nothing, who had lost a child, who was being pilloried in the press by reporters and his ex-wife and who verged on having his life’s work destroyed. “He has the ability to work harder and endure more stress than anyone I’ve ever met,” Gracias said. “What he went through in 2008 would have broken anyone else. He didn’t just survive. He kept working and stayed focused.”"</li>
		<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk:_Tesla,_SpaceX,_and_the_Quest_for_a_Fantastic_Future">Elon Musk's Biography: </a>"[Musk] would trap an engineer in the SpaceX factory and set to work grilling him about a type of valve or specialized material. “I thought at first that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff,” said Kevin Brogan, one of the early engineers. “Then I realized he was trying to learn things. He would quiz you until he learned ninety percent of what you know.” People who have spent significant time with Musk will attest to his abilities to absorb incredible quantities of information with near-flawless recall. It’s one of his most impressive and intimidating skills and seems to work just as well in the present day as it did when he was a child vacuuming books into his brain."</li>
		<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">Meditations</a>: "People try to get away from it all - to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic; you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. Nowhere you can go is more peaceful - more free of interruptions - than your own soul."</li>
		<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">Meditations</a>: "Stop drifting. You're not going to re-read your Brief Comments, your Deeds of the Ancient Greeks and Romans, the commonplace books you saved for your old age. Sprint for the finish. Write off your hopes, and if your well-being matters to you, be your own savior while you can."</li>
		<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations">Meditations</a>: "Not just that every day more of our life is used up and less and less of it is left, but this too: if we live longer, can we be sure our mind will still be up to understanding the world [...] So we need to hurry. Not just because we move daily closer to death but also because our understanding - our grasp of the world - may be gone before we get there."</li>
