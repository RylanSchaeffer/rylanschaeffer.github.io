Grid cells are a Nobel-prize winning 🏆🏆🏆 neural representation found in the mammalian brain 🧠, that play a fundamental role in spatial navigation 🚶 🛣️

Where do these representations come from ⁉️ 🔎

One leading theory is the so-called "Unified theory for the origin of grid cells" by @SuryaGanguli

The Unified Theory posits that grid cells arise due to predicting place cells, another type of neural representation 🧠

We identify 2 critical mathematical assumptions that the Unified Theory rests upon:

1) Place cells, as a population, must be translationally invariant

2) Place cells, individually, must have center-surround tuning

Is either assumption biologically valid? 🤔🤔

Let's test ! 👨‍🔬

Using 320 place cell recording sessions, we propose 2 ways to quantify whether place cells are translationally invariant

Conclusion? Assumption 1 appears biologically unlikely ❌

Also, spatial autocorrelation matrices don't display the assumed constant-diagonal structure

Extracellularly, place cells don't exhibit center-surround tuning.

We dig through the literature 📜 to discover place cell subthreshold voltages also do not exhibit center surround tuning (right)

Conclusion? Assumption 2 also appears biologically unlikely ❌
