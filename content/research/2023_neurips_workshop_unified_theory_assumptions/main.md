1/7

Grid cells are a Nobel-prize winning 🏆🏆🏆 neural representation found in the mammalian brain 🧠, that play a fundamental role in spatial navigation 🚶 🛣️

Where do these representations come from ⁉️ 🔎

2/7


One leading theory is the so-called "Unified theory for the origin of grid cells"

The Unified Theory posits that grid cells arise due to predicting place cells, another type of neural representation 🧠

3/7

We rigorously test the Unified Theory's applicability to biological grid cells.

We identify 2 critical mathematical assumptions:

1) Place cells, as a population, must be translationally invariant

2) Place cells, individually, must have center-surround tuning

4/7



Using 320 recording sessions, we propose 2 ways to quantify whether place cells are translationally invariant

Under both metrics, this assumption appears biologically unlikely ❌

Also, spatial autocorrelation matrices don't display the constant-diagonal structure required

5/7



Extracellularly, place cells don't exhibit center-surround tuning (left). 

We dig through the literature to also discover place cell intracellular potentials, which also do not exhibit center surround tuning (right)

This assumption also appears biologically unlikely ❌

6/7

Together, this casts doubt on the Unified Theory's relevance to bio grid cells 🤔
