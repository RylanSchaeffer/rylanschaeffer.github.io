Grid cells are a Nobel-prize winning neural representation found in the mammalian brain, that play a fundamental role in spatial navigation

Where do these representations come from?

One leading theory in #NeuroAI is the so-called "Unified theory for the origin of grid cells" by @SuryaGanguli Ben Sorscher & Gabe Mel

The Unified Theory posits that grid cells arise due to predicting place cells, another type of neural representation

3/8

We identify 2 critical mathematical assumptions that the Unified Theory rests upon:

1) Place cells, as a population, must be translationally invariant

2) Place cells, individually, must have center-surround tuning

Is either assumption biologically valid? 

Let's test !

Using 320 place cell recording sessions, we propose 2 ways to quantify whether place cells are translationally invariant and also qualitatively visualize their spatial autocorrelations

Conclusion: Place cells unlikely to be translationally invariant ‚ùå

5/8

Extracellularly, place cells don't exhibit center-surround tuning.

We dig through the literature to discover place cell subthreshold voltages also do not exhibit center surround tuning (right)

Conclusion: Place cells unlikely to have center surround tuning ‚ùå

Together, these cast doubt on Unified Theory's relevance to bio grid cells  @unireps: https://openreview.net/forum?id=vYixJUwAD4
