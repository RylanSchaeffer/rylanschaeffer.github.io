## Summary

We had meant to keep this under wraps for a couple weeks, but it seems that the cat is out of the bag.

Excited to announce our newest preprint: [Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.15004)

Recent work claims that LLMs display emergent abilities, abilities not present in smaller-scale models that are present in larger-scale models.
What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: (1) sharpness (not present -> present) and (2) unpredictability.
We ask whether emergent abilities might be better explained by the researcher's
