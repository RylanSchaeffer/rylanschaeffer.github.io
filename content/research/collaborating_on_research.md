# Collaborating on Research with Me

Thanks for thinking about reaching out to me to discuss collaborating! I tremendously enjoy working with people, so
I'm always excited to hear from potential new collaborators. Unfortunatelyy, collaborations have not always gone well for me,
so here is what I look for in potential collaborators:

- Please clearly and succinctly communicate to me your relevant skills and capabilities. A resume can be attached, but I'm looking
  for 1-3 sentences summarizing what you bring to the table. If neither a description nor
  a resume is provided, I cannot evaluate whether you might be someone I want to work with.
  I don't necessarily reject potential collaborators for lacking credentials so long as the potential collaborator is open
  about this but explicitly describes what other advantages they have.

-  Tell me what you are specifically interested in working together on. My projects are almost always structured
around a specific research goal, typically in one of three flavors: scientific, mathematical, or engineering. If you can phrase
what goals you are interested in working on in terms of these three flavors, that would be very helpful.

- The trait that I've found to be most important in research (and other areas) is being
[relentlessly resourceful](https://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html). Because this trait is not easily evaluated from a resume,
I will likely suggest a trial period of working together. I will be more willing to skip a trial period if you show me
preliminary evidence of work that you've already done.
