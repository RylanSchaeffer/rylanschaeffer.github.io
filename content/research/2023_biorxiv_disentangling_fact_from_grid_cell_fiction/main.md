## Summary

If you thought our #NeurIPS 2022 paper was spicy, our newest preprint burns twice as hard🌶️🌶️

🧠🧠 Disentangling Fact from Grid Cell Fiction in Trained Deep Path Integrators 🧠🧠

🧵👇

1/N

Over the past 5 years, high-profile papers in Nature, Neuron, NeurIPS & ICLR claimed that training
deep networks to path integrate robustly, generically and surprisingly produce grid-like units
matching those in the mammalian medial entorhinal cortex 🧠

2/N

Our paper NFL challenged this path integration hypothesis by showing

1) grid-like tuning does not emerge in deep recurrent networks trained to path integrate

2) unless researchers insert grid-like tuning via supervised targets designed to produce grids, unrelated to path int

3/N

@SuryaGanguli coordinated a Response to NFL's with several others @dyamins @lisa_giocomo @aran_nayebi ,
defending the path integration hypothesis.

4/N

Our new preprint: 

1. explains how the Response misrepresents & confirms NFL

2. evaluates the Response’s “Unified Theory for the origin of grid cells” & show it is _at best_ “occasionally suggestive”

3. questions why neural regressions reached the wrong conclusion
