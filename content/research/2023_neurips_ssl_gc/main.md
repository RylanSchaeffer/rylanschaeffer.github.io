"Self-supervised learning representations of space generates multi-modular grid cells"

1/N


What are grid cells? The mammalian brain has evolved these bizarre non-local multi-periodic representations for physical space, which is a local and non-periodic variable! ü§îü§î

2/N

Why this peculiar representation? We identify and draw from 4 previous approaches: supervised learning, optimization, coding theory and continuous attractors all provided insight, but had their own limitations and assumptions ‚Äì

3/N

Our work would not have been possible without these previous approaches: we *combine* their strengths,  overcoming limitations by framing spatial navigation as a self-supervised learning problem - the SSL objective is contrastive, similar to objectives like SimCLR!

4/N

An important ingredient in SSL is the data augmentation scheme and architecture: we use an RNN (with a normalizing non-linearity) which takes in velocity sequences and augment our sequences with permutations:

5/N

We find that optimizing this setup *can* generate multi-modular grid cells! ü§Øü§Ø

6/N

We also see that the representation generalizes ~out of distribution~ overcoming limitations in previous work and showing that a multi-modular grid representation is high capacity, as identified by previous theory work from @FieteGroup

7/N

Dissecting a single module using fourier analysis and topological data analysis produces the striking twisted toroidal topology üç©that grid cells are known for (see amazing experimental and analysis work from @adric_dunn
